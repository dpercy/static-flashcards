workflow:
- edit text files in a git clone
- commit
	- linter checks parse errors
- push
- view some URL
	- do today's cards
	- remembers answers in localstorage


data model:
- card has front and back
	- some text expands to many cards
	- card has an eternal ID (sha1)
	- ID collisions not allowed on publish (rare; just reword it)
- raw observations at runtime:
	{time, card_id, score1234}
queries:
- read: what cards are due on-or-before today?
	- range from earliest due date to today
	- can step by 1 day since localStorage lacks range queries
- write: update card
	- due date
	- other weights / parameters
storage maps:
- () -> earliest due date
- due date -> [card ids]
- card id -> weights
	- maybe split by scheduler

or dumber storage:
- sorted list of (due date, card id)
- 



impl order:
[ ] basic
	[x] parse cards (simple only)
	[-] present one card
	[x] schedule on answer (dumb 2x 0x)
	[x] present first due card
	[x] button to reveal answer
		- UI state only
	[x] button to record whether correct
		- reschedules
[ ] write some cards!
[ ] extensions
	[ ] expand during parse
	[ ] good scheduler

	[ ] shuffle presentation order
		- to avoid familiar patterns when practicing
		- det - for stability on refresh
