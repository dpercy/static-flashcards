workflow:
- edit text files in a git clone
- commit
	- linter checks parse errors
- push
- view some URL
	- do today's cards
	- remembers answers in localstorage


data model:
- card has front and back
	- some text expands to many cards
	- card has an eternal ID (sha1)
	- ID collisions not allowed on publish (rare; just reword it)
- raw observations at runtime:
	{time, card_id, score1234}
queries:
- read: what cards are due on-or-before today?
	- range from earliest due date to today
	- can step by 1 day since localStorage lacks range queries
- write: update card
	- due date
	- other weights / parameters
storage maps:
- () -> earliest due date
- due date -> [card ids]
- card id -> weights
	- maybe split by scheduler




impl order:
[ ] basic
	[x] parse cards (simple only)
	[ ] present one card
	[ ] schedule on answer (dumb 2x 0x)
	[ ] present first due card
[ ] extensions
	[ ] expand during parse
	[ ] good scheduler
